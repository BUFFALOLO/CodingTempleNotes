# This method takes two arguments: the index where you want to add the item & the item itself.

# Changing an Item in a List: If you want to change an existing item in a list, you simply assign a new value to its specific index.
# If you want to change reading into writing

# Removing by Value: If you know the exact item you want to remove, you can use the remove() method. 
# This method finds the first occurrence of the specified value & removes it from the list.

# Popping Items: The pop() method is used to remove items by their position or index. 
# If you donâ€™t provide an index, pop() will remove the last item in the list by default. You can also specify an index to remove a specific item.

# If you're finished with a list & want to remove all its items at once you can use the clear() method.
# This method empties the list, leaving it blank but still available for future use.
# After running this code the hobbies list will be completely empty and will show [], indicating that all the items have been removed. 
# This is a quick & easy way to reset a list without deleting the list iteself.
