Python Adventure: Mastering Variables
To solidify your understanding, write a Python script that demonstrates each of the above concepts. Here's a simple guide:
    Declare a variable and assign it a value. Print its type.
    Reassign a different type of value to the same variable. Print its new type.
    Assign values to multiple variables in one line and print them.
    Use at lease two variable names that follow the naming conventions.
